- Used when we want some task to continue executing in the background but also exit when the main application exits.
- Killed by the JVM as soon as no user thread is running any longer. Can be stopped normally too - just like normal threads.
- "main" thread is a "user" thread - not "daemon".
- Any kind of logic as desired can be put in daemon threads. E.g. - Directory watcher thread.LoopTaskB
- Although daemon threads can be created using the normal threads API, but can also be created using the Executors API.
When creating daemon threads using the executors API, we have to implement the ThreadFactory and manipulate the thread
there to make it 'daemon'.
