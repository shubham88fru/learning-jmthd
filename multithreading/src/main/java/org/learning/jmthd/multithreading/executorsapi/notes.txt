Executors api is the preferred way of running tasks:
- Uses thread pools.
- Allocates heavy-weight threads upfront.
- Decouples task submission from thread creation and management.
- Each thread in the pool executes multiple tasks one-by-one.
- A tasks-queue holds the tasks.
- Threads are stopped after completing the pending tasks when
    the executor service is shutdown (shutdown()).
- To shut down executor service immediately, use `shutdownNow()`

Some frequently referred classes/interfaces while using executors framework:
- Executor (Interface)
- ExecutorService (Interface)
- Executors (Class)
- Future (Interface)
